# typeset

Docker container for typesetting documents, e.g. for use with GitHub Actions.

You can use this container with a GitHub Action to have a document typeset on every commit to a repository; see `github-action-sample.yml` for an example.

This container is published to [`ghcr.io/weinshel/typeset`](https://github.com/weinshel/Dockerfiles/pkgs/container/typeset).
